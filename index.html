                <p>Hearing is a biological phenomenon where sound enters our ears and is perceived as sound. We don’t
                    have to put any effort into hearing.

                <h1 class="w3-text-orange">What is active listening?</h1>
                <p>Listening is a physiological phenomenon involving our whole selves. We listen through our <i>ears</i>
                    and
                    also <i>eyes</i>. We need to put our <i>mind</i> into listening - where we put meaning to the sounds
                    we hear.</p>
                <p></p>Active listening goes a step beyond this - where we listen with intent. Our minds need to make an
                effort to be attentive; understanding what the other is saying and going below the surface of what is
                initially present.

                <p>Passively listening is like observing a house from the street. While we can admire the beautiful
                    architecture of the house from the outside, we will miss the beauty of the inside of the house. We
                    can’t discover the different rooms of the house.</p>
                <p>In conversations, active listening allows us to unlock the doors and walk through the rooms
                    discovering new context and diving deeper into the conversation. (Credit: Hrishikesh Hirway, TED's
                    Talk gives this symbolism).</p>

            <div class="w3-half w3-container">
                <h1 class="w3-text-purple">As People</h1>
                <p> As humans we want to, we need to be listened to. As Kate Murphy discusses in “You're Not Listening:
                    What You're Missing and Why It Matters”, she describes how not being listened to causes loneliness.
                    Loneliness is described as a public health crisis. Both listening and having someone that listens
                    are important for mental health. For ours and those we love.</p>

                <p>As Murphy puts it only through listening, “engage, understand, connect, empathize as human beings”
                    (Murphy 2). No relationship will work without listening - we have two years and one month for a
                    reason.</p>

                <p>Moreover, miscommunication has disastrous consequences - fatal consequences. Wars have been fought
                    over for a lack of listening. As an example: disasters like those of United Airlines 173 demonstrate
                    the consequences of not listening.</p>

                <p>The airplane had a landing gear issue that the captain, the person responsible for making final
                    decisions, became fixated on. The fixation caused the airplane to run out of fuel. Accident
                    investigators cited that the captain failed to “properly respond to [..] the crewmember’s advisories
                    regarding fuel state” (NTSB 5). Not listening costs lives, that’s why listening matters.

            <div class="w3-half w3-container" id="listening">
                <h1 class="w3-text-purple">As Tutors</h1>
                <p>As tutors, our listening skills aren't necessarily “life saving”. Yet - despite this being able to
                    listen to others is still critical to the success of our students. With active listening skills we
                    may be able to help students identify the problem they need help with. Sometimes, there may be other
                    issues like poor studying skills, that are contributing to their struggles. Knowing this can help us
                    as tutors know how we can help our students develop further independence.</p>

                <p>Kate Murphy mentions how some conversations that had active listening allowed her interviewees to
                    notice stuff they haven’t before. Our active listening skills can help our students experience the
                    same - and allow themselves to reflect and improve as students, independently.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Be open to new ideas -</b> When we listen we have to be open minded and be ready to learn
                        something new. If our mind doesn't want to listen we aren’t active listeners. As tutors, we need
                        open-mindedness to help us identify struggles our students have. </li>
                    <li><b>Stop multitasking -</b> Physically we need to stop what we’re doing and listen. We need to
                        make
                        eye contact and listen. Within us, within our thoughts, we need to not multitask too. We can not
                        fully appreciate what someone else says while thinking about something else. As tutors, we need
                        to
                        focus on the student when we’re listening to them. We don’t want to be thinking about our own
                        work
                        or other tutees. We also don’t want to be forming judgments as they speak. Our minds need to be
                        fully occupied on what they say.</li>
                    <li><b>Let the other person know you’re engaged without drawing focus on yourself -</b> relating
                        from
                        personal experiences aren’t a form of active listening. Physically we can nod to let the other
                        person know we’re engaged. From training level 1, we learned that careful useful use of silence
                        is
                        also a skill. We make space for people and our tutees to think. But at other times, we may have
                        to
                        ask questions to engage and dig deeper. As tutors we can do the same to help our students build
                        their independence by identifying the underlying struggles they have.</li>
                    <li><b>Listen to non-verbal cues -</b> We want to listen to non-verbal cues like body language. We
                        can
                        use body language to identify how they feel.</li>
                    <li><b>Paraphrase and summarize -</b> repeating what people say can indicate to the person we are
                        listening to really understand what they said.</li>
                    <li><b>Practice -</b> listening is a lifelong skill. We need to practice listening in order to be
                        better
                        at it.</li>

                <p>Let’s take time to reflect on what active listening is. Act as if you are working with a student who
                    had an assignment on active listening. Create questions based on Bloom’s Taxonomy that you could use
                    to
                    determine how well a student understands the terms, themes, and arguments presented. Answer them
                    too. This question will not be graded, it is for your reflection. Please print out this section and
                    upload to Classes. Sample questions have been provided.</p>
